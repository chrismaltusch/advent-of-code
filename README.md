# Advent of Code 2023 - Personal Python Journey

## Introduction

Welcome to the thrilling world of coding challenges! This README is mytrusty guide as I embark on the Advent of Code, a journey filled with puzzles and learning. Perfect for novices, this Python adventure promises fun and growth.

## Getting Started

1. **Set Up Your Environment**:
   - **Install Python**: Make sure you have Python installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - **Choose an Editor**: Any text editor works, but [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) can make your life easier.

2. **Clone This Repository**:
   - Run `git clone https://github.com/chrismaltusch/advent-of-code.git`.
   - Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd advent-of-code`.

3. **Understand the Structure**:
   - `day-xx/`: Where your Python solutions will live.
   - `input.txt`: Contains input files for each day's challenge.

4. **Daily Challenges**:
   - Each day, a new problem will be released on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).
   - Download the problem input and save it in the `input/` directory.

## How to Use This Repository

- **Read the Problem**: Start each day by reading the problem on the Advent of Code website.
- **Write Your Code**: In the `solutions/` directory, create a Python script for the day's challenge (e.g., `day1.py`).
- **Run Your Script**: Execute your script using Python and see the magic happen. Run `python solutions/day1.py`.
- **Celebrate Your Solution**: Once your code runs successfully and you get the correct answer, celebrate your achievement!

## Tips for Success

- **Start Simple**: Don't worry about the "best" solution. Focus on getting *a* solution first.
- **Use Resources**: Stuck? Python's [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) is your friend. Also, sites like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are great for getting help.
- **Learn by Doing**: Each problem is an opportunity to learn something new. Embrace the challenges!
- **Share and Discuss**: Join the [Advent of Code subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/) or find a community to discuss solutions and ideas.

## Remember

Coding is a journey, not a race. Each problem solved is a step forward in your coding adventure. Enjoy each challenge, learn from your mistakes, and celebrate your victories, no matter how small!
